Assignment-1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this assignment, the goal is to build a Na√Øve Bayes classification model that is able to predict the class (category) of an unseen document correctly out of 91 classes. You are given the following datasets.

1-  A training dataset: a collection of 91 folders whose names represent the class of the contained documents, i.e., the class of a specific document is the name of the folder holding this file. That means, all the documents are labeled.
2-  A test dataset: this dataset has an organization similar to what is mentioned for the training dataset, i.e., the documents in the test sets are labeled and ready for evaluation purposes.
